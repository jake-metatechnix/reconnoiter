usernameGen
-------------
usernameGen is a couple of scripts which create potential usernames
by querying Google or Yahoo for company on Linkedin.com.  It's 
similar to searching for "site:linkedin.com SomeCompanyName".  The
scripts then takes the results, tries to clean them up, and creates
possible usernames from the names in the results.

Currently supported username combinations are:

  - first initial + last name
  - first name + last initial
  - last name + first initial
  - first initial + middle initial + last name

If you have other username schemes you have seen, please let me know.


Requirements:
  - Python 2.5
  - A Yahoo AppID, if you want to use usernameGenYahoo.py

Usage:
-----------
The scripts are pretty straight forward. 

 > ./usernameGen.py CompanyName #ofResultsToFetch

or

 > ./usernameGenYahoo.py CompanyName YahooAPP-ID #ofResultsToFetch

The scripts will echo the usernames to STDOUT, so you can dump them to
a text file by adding "> username.list" to the end of the examples.
